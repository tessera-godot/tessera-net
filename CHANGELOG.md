## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Benchmarks page with charts (`docs/benchmarks.md`) and a script to regenerate them (`tools/make_charts.py`).
- Source of every benchmark in `bench/`: the data core acceptance benchmark, the comparison with a
  general-purpose ECS, the comparison with Godot nodes, and the baseline of Godot's built-in replication.
- Data core: `EntityId`, paged `EntityTable`, `TypeRegistry`, `ThreadPoolJobSystem`, `CommandBuffers`,
  `SpatialGrid` and `TickLoop` (see `docs/reference/core.md`).
- Integration and determinism tests, and an acceptance benchmark (`tessera_net_bench`).
- Architecture decision records 0004 (per-type paged tables) and 0005 (entity identification).
- Project skeleton: CMake build, presets for Windows and Linux, a minimal test runner, and the
  documentation structure.
